# NeoNodule Project

## Purpose

The project aims at curating the data and information published about hydrogeneous manganese deposits since the concept was originated by Carl Wilhelm Von Gümbel in 1861 
and marine manganese nodules where recovered during the Challenger Expedition of 1872–76 and further analysed by John Murray and his associates. It stems from the past 
compiling efforts of the NOAA-NGDC Marine Minerals Data Base. It is building from the recent development of Internet accessed bibliographic and 
data stores as well as the global data management capabilities offered by the new tools of the Semantic Web initially incepted by Tim Berners-Lee in 2001 
(see the on-line map display https://teravue.github.io/NeoNodule/maps/neonodule_map.html )
